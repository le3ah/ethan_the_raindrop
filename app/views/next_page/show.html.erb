<h3>Somewhere over the big blue ocean,</h3>
<h3>He felt a change had been set in motion.</h3>
<h3>Suddenly his brother started to shout,</h3>
<h3>Telling the cloud what the change was about.</h3>
<h3>"Soon we will be starting our trip.</h3>
<h3>Water for the ground starts with a drip!"</h3>
<br>
<h3>Ethan's brother was in a hurry,</h3>
<h3>But leaving the cloud filled Ethan with worry.</h3>
<h3>"I know you're scared, in your eyes I see it,</h3>
<h3>But on the ground is where we're needed."</h3>
<h3>First there were things Ethan wanted to know.</h3>
<h3>He asked, "What will I be, where will I go?"</h3>
<br>
<h3>"Whether a drop of rain or a flake of snow,</h3>
<h3>You'll be what you'll be and you'll know when you know.</h3>
<h3>With help from Father Sun and Mother Moon,</h3>
<h3>You'll get where you're going and you'll get there soon.</h3>
<h3>Whether you're high in the mountains or out in the sea,</h3>
<h3>When you look around, you'll see family!"</h3>
